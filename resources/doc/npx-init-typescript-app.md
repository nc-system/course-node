This is clean framework/technology agnostic TypeScript setup.

First of all, it's written to help quickly create npm packages in TypeScript. With init-typescript-app you can think only about your project. All other things init-typescript-app will take care of the rest.

It's also a good idea to use it like a starting point for any of your projects.

ðŸ“¦ What in the box
Customizable TypeScript configuration. If you just want to make your project work in TypeScript and not get a lot of difficulties which may be related with it, you can choose base mode. By the way, it's the greatest choice if you just start learning TypeScript. For advanced TypeScript users there is advanced node which includes all kinds of checks.

Easy and quick publication. No more fuss with entering the same npm and git commands, no more mistakes during the publication process. Make your package publication happen by running one command.

Other features are on their way. Please, read about upcoming features in roadmap section.
